## About Me

"A precipitous slope, a narrow river width, a fast and violent flow. The state of the water is perfectly decided yet, water obeys only itself. Water is only water. Thoroughly water. Absolutely free." <br>
-- Miyamoto Musashi, Chapter 305: "The Water Path"


My name is Bhargav Pratim Nath, and I am a  junior undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT BHU), majoring in Civil Engineering and Signals and Systems. Utilizing statistical methods to assess structural health is what I fell for. Thankfully life didn't end here, some oil painting on a nice summer Sunday and a few dark novels in my leisure time are what I live for.

## Projects

### 	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING USING REDUCED-ORDER VARIATIONAL MODE DECOMPOSITION (RVMD): 

Engaged in an exploratory project guided by Associate Professor [Dr. Basuraj Bhowmik]([[url]([https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/civ/people/basurajciv])])


ðŸ“… Duration:  July'23-Septâ€™23

Description:

- Studied the suitability of RVMD on the acceleration response of 5DOF structure for health monitoring.
- Optimized parameters to get the physical modes' shapes and natural frequencies.
- The final model developed reconstructs the modal signal for the 5DOF system.
  -- The raw, reconstructed, and modal signals' power spectrum are shown along with their mode shapes and responses. 

This endeavour seamlessly merged theoretical insights with practical application, exemplifying my commitment to pushing the boundaries of engineering knowledge.

### DAMAGE DETECTION OF UNDERGROUND USING PCA

A Project under Assistant Professor [Dr. Basuraj Bhowmik]([[url]([https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/civ/people/basurajciv])])


ðŸ“… Duration:  Aug '23-Present

Description:

- Efficient extraction and manipulation of Large-Scale sensor data exceeding 1GB utilizing Microsoft Excel and MATLAB.
- Isolating and comparing the dominant components of both impaired signal and undamaged signal using PCA.
- Leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) effectively and precisely identifies pipeline damage
locations by analyzing multidimensional sensor data.
-  Principle Component Analysis(PCA), Signal Processing, Matlab, Graphical Analysis, Teamwork, Microsoft Excel.
  --  The final results quantify damage in the pipe based on the Eigen Variance Index (EVI), predicts the exact location of damage, works excellently under an SNR of 2. The performance of the model is shown below. 

This endeavour seamlessly merged theoretical insights with practical application, exemplifying my commitment to pushing the boundaries of engineering knowledge.
